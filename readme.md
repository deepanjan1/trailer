#My Movie Trailer

##Overview
This python code produces an HTML file that displays my top 6 movies.  The HTML page will display
the movie's title and movie poster.  You will be able to access the movie trailer by clicking on
the movie poster or title.

##Installation
Download the entire directory /trailer.  On Mac, open up terminal, and on PC open up the command
line. Point to where you've downloaded the directory /trailer.  Then, type in the following:
`python entertainment.py`.  

Doing so will open up your default web browser and render the page.
